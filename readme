Description:
    puma is a command line tool for interfacing with nova

Setup and Installation:
    1) Install the dependancies
        a. Install boto: sudo apt-get install python-boto or downloading at
        http://code.google.com/p/boto/downloads/list
        b. Download PyYaml: http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML
        c. Install PyYaml: cd /path/to/pyyaml; sudo setup.py install

    After you have installed all the dependancies you have to make a .puma directory in your home directory.
    You also have to make a folder that holds all of your credentials

    2) mkdir ~/.puma
    3) mkdir ~/.puma/creds

    Once this is done and u have copied your credentials to the "creds" folder you can now make your config file.

    4) Create the config file:
        here is an example config file

        access_id: <access key id>
        access_secret: <secret key>
        keyfile: keyfile.pem
        port: 8773
        ip: 127.0.0.1
        location: nova
        path: services/Cloud
        keyname: keyname

    You should fill in the key file with the apropriate information unless the defualts are fine for you.

    5) Edit your bashrc file to include the line:
        export PATH=${PATH}:/home/joel/puma/bin
